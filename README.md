# Object Detection using HaarCascade Classifier
Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.

Here I have detected the face as well as eyes in an image as well as in a video using VideoCapture function present in OpenCV library.

I have also worked on vehicle detection of an image as well as Counting number of bikes in a video.

This does NOT contain the test video due to large file constraint on Github.
